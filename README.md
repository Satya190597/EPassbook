### Summary.
```
    Users can add a new transaction.
    A new transaction must contain the beneficiary name, amount type, and transaction type.
    A transaction can be in an active or in an inactive state.
    Users can cancel an active transaction.
    Canceling an active transaction will create a new transaction with the reverse transaction category.
    Users can also reset the entire transaction history.
